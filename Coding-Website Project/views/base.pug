                //- | This company, 'Application Aryan Official' was created by Mr. Aryan Sisodiya, our founder. The story starts when he was just 13 years old and a 8th class Student, the one of his interest was Programming, at that time his teacher was teaching him Python, one of the chapter of his computer book. When he started Python Programming His aim was to complete Python, to learn it completely and he did, He completed his Python Programming in about 4 months, He then wanted to create apps that excute with a Graphical Window not in a boring console, that was the point when he started programming for GUI's, he started learning Tkinter from the free of cost YouTube Channel 'CodeWithHarry', as soon as he completed Tkinter. In about 2 months and started creating Python Apps. The name 'Application Aryan Official' came to mind of Mr. Aryan Sisodiya when he was the making the first application of his first Programming Language, Python. He want to give a greeting message to his users who will use his Applications but he was not having any Frictional Company name, then he thought about the 'Khan Sir', one of the Teacher from Bihar and having a YouTube Channel, he was liked to see his videos, At that time, Khan Sir launched his Application 'Khan Sir Official'. So the name 'Application Aryan Official' came into his mind and named his Frictional Company. As soon as he completed complete Web Development and started creating Websites and he converted the Frictional Company 'Application Aryan Official' into a real Company.
